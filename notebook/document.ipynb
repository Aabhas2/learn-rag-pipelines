Write programs in Python using NumPy library to do the following: \\na.   Compute the mean, standard deviation, and variance of a two dimensional random integer array along \\nthe second axis. \\nb.    Create a 2-dimensional array of size m x n integer elements, also print the shape, type and data type of \\nthe array and then   reshape it into an n x m array, where  n and m are user inputs given at the run time. \\nc.  Test whether the elements of a given 1D array are zero, non-zero and NaN. Record the indices of these \\nelements in three separate arrays. \\nd. Create three random arrays of the same size: Array1, Array2 and Array3. Subtract Array 2 from Array3 \\nand store in Array4. Create another array Array5 having two times the values  in Array1. Find Co-\\nvariance and Correlation of  Array1 with  Array4 and Array5 respectively. \\ne. Create two random arrays of the same size 10: Array1, and Array2. Find the sum of the first half of both \\nthe arrays and product of the second half of both the arrays. \\n \\n \\n2.  Consider two data files (in CSV format) having attendance of  two workshops. Each file has three fields ‘Name’, \\n‘Date, duration (in minutes) where names are unique within a file. Note that duration may take one of three \\nvalues (30, 40, 50) only. Import the data into two data frames and do the following: \\na. Perform merging of the two data frames to find the names of students who had attended both \\nworkshops. \\nb.  Find names of all students who have attended a single workshop only. \\nc. Merge two data frames row-wise and find the total number of records in the data frame. \\nd. Merge two data frames row-wise and use two columns viz. names and dates as multi-row indexes. \\nGenerate descriptive statistics for this hierarchical data frame. \\n \\n3. Consider the following data frame containing a family name, gender of the family member and her/his monthly \\nincome in each record. \\nName   \\nGender \\n MonthlyIncome (Rs.) \\nShah   \\nMale   \\n   114000.00 \\nVats   \\nMale   \\n   65000.00 \\nVats   \\nFemale  \\n   43150.00 \\nKumar  \\nFemale  \\n   69500.00 \\nVats   \\nFemale  \\n   155000.00 \\nKumar  \\nMale   \\n   103000.00 \\nShah   \\nMale                     55000.00 \\nShah   \\nFemale  \\n   112400.00 \\nKumar  \\nFemale  \\n   81030.00 \\nVats   \\nMale   \\n    71900.00 \\nWrite a program in Python using Pandas to perform the following: \\na.
